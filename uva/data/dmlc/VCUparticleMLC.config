/* Configuration File for MLC leafs to be used by DMLC program and other
   programs that need to know about the MLC's

   Modification History:
      August 17, 2000: JVS: Created
      Dec    28, 2000: JVS: Add "index" section...
      Jan 16, 2001: JVS: Setting 120 closedOffset to 0.06 from 0.08
                         Added grooveDistance and grooveThickness
      April 12, 2002: JVS: Add physicalLeafOffset
      Jan 7, 2002: JVS: Add a few comments so distribution is clearer
      Nov 1, 2004: IBM: Change the table file names for 120 Leaf MLC
      Feb 16, 2005: IBM: Change the table file names for 80 Leaf MLC   
      Feb 5, 2007: JVS: Change table names for distribution   
      May 20, 2015: JVS: Changing density and physicalLeafOffset for TrueBeam test.  Also removed 80 leaf MLC.
